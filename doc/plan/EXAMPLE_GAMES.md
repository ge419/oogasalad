### Three Game Examples

The three games we have chosen are Shoots and Ladders, Candy Land, and Monopoly.

1. Shoots and Ladders is a simple board game that involves players rolling a die and moving their game piece along a path of numbered squares. However, some squares contain chutes or ladders that can either set the player back or propel them forward. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the final square.


2. Candy Land is another board game that has a similar objective of being the first to reach the end, but the way players move their game piece is different. Instead of rolling a die, players draw colored cards that match a series of colored squares on the board, and move their game piece to the next square of that color. This game also has special tiles that allow players to advance or go back a few spaces, but unlike Shoots and Ladders, these tiles are not as common.


3. Monopoly, a more complex board game, involves trading properties and paying rent. Players move around the board by rolling dice and can land on different types of tiles such as properties, utility spaces, and chance cards. The game has a lot of rules that govern how players interact with the properties, including buying, selling, and upgrading them. The objective of the game is to accumulate the most wealth by the end of the game.

### Different Games, Shared Functionalities/ Features
Despite their differences, all three games share some functional commonalities. For instance, all three games have a path of traversal that the players move along. This path can include special tiles or squares that affect the player's progress. Additionally, all three games have rules that occur during landing and traversal, such as taking a penalty or bonus for landing on certain squares or being sent back to the beginning. Finally, all three games have actions that players take, such as rolling a die or drawing a card, which determine their movement on the board.


### Conclusion
In conclusion, Shoots and Ladders, Candy Land, and Monopoly are excellent examples of games that can illustrate the different functionalities of our game engine. All of these games will be abstracted to the notion of players traversing across a *path*, following a set of *rules* that occur during traversal and landing, which cause or allow the player to do specific *actions* like roll, draw a card, pay rent or build a house.


By using these games, we can abstract a set of core functionalities that our game engine can support that could potentially allow for the creation of other games such as Sorry, Backgammon and more (although these are not in our current plans).
