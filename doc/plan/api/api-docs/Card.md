**Overview**

- An abstract card class for a monopoly game would have the following concrete implementations: money, property, chance cards, and chest cards. It allows for extension in that we can create a new subclass of the Card abstract class for Monopoly variations that we decide to create that have other cards (or any similar board game that involves the use of cards).
- The Card abstraction is only responsible for the frontend implementation of the card. Once a subclass is created, we would not need to make any modifications to the code. Instead, to create a new type of card a new subclass would be added. All subclasses of cards will be able to substitute each other; for instance, even if we replace a Money Card object with a Chance card object, the frontend would still compile and render. To follow the interface separation principle and the dependency inversion principle, we will use the \`Clickable\`, \`Moveable\`, and \`Mutable\`interfaces that only some of the Card subclasses implement.Â 

  


**Considerations**

- Representation of different types of cards: The Card abstraction needs to be designed in a way that allows for different types of cards to be represented and used in the game, such as money cards, property cards, and chance cards. One design decision that needs to be made is whether to use inheritance or composition to represent different types of cards. Inheritance can lead to a large and complex class hierarchy, while composition can result in more flexible and modular code.


- Encapsulation of card state: The Card abstraction needs to be designed in a way that encapsulates the state of each card and provides a consistent interface for accessing and modifying that state. One design decision is whether to make the Card class mutable or immutable. Mutable classes can be easier to work with, but can also lead to unintended side effects and make it more difficult to reason about the behavior of the program.


- Handling of card effects: The Card abstraction needs to be designed in a way that allows for the different effects of each card to be implemented and applied in the game. One design decision is whether to implement the effects of each card directly in the Card class or to delegate the responsibility to other classes or interfaces. Direct implementation can simplify the code, but can also result in tight coupling between classes and make the codebase more difficult to maintain.


- Interaction with other game components: The Card abstraction needs to be designed in a way that allows for interaction with other game components, such as players, the board, and the game state. One design decision is whether to allow direct interaction between the Card class and other game components or to use a mediator or observer pattern to manage interactions. Direct interaction can simplify the code, but can also result in tight coupling between classes and make the codebase more difficult to maintain.
