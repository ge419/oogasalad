 * Implements the core engine for running a game.

 * <p>A game consists of a list of rules, which listens to events that are emitted by actions they
 * create. The engine supports subgames, which allow a different set of rules to be run temporarily.
 * Once the subgame has exhausted all actions in its queue, it returns to the parent game with the
 * original ruleset. Parent rules hear events emitted by the subgame, but actions that they register
 * do not run until the subgame is complete.
